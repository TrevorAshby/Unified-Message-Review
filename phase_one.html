        <h1>Phase One: Message Hanler Test</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In this first phase, we will be evaluating the effectiveness and functionality of the Message Access Layer (MAL) and the Message Processing Layer (Handler). To do this, our integration tests will construct sample MAL inputs and provide them to the Handler, then the tests will monitor the Handlers actions and final outputs of the inputs. The following tests will directly evaluate the following functional and non-functional requirements from the original document: FR1 - Send and Batch Send Messages, FR2 - Real-Time and Scheduled Message Delivery, FR3 - Message Deduplication, FR4 - Multi-Channel Support, FR5 - Rate Limiting and Traffic Control, FR6 - Night-time Blocking and Next-day Sending, and NFR2 - Scalability.</p>
