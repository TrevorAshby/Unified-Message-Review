        <h1>Test Plan</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>For this project, we intend to conduct a series with three phases of integration testing, starting with the Message Handler (phase 1), which takes in user input and translates that into a structured message that is given a request ID, is screened and processed by a Handler that then passes it on the Task Scheduler (phase 2). This scheduler translates the messages into a Task object and then executes it via a crontable, and finally saves the task to the database (phase 3). Finally, the Backend and Database Components store the tasks and associated data in an SQL table along with other features that include a log table, an ELK Framework, and log cleaner to help maintain the backend systems.</p> 
        <p>With this type of application, we felt that the best way to test this system was through a step-by-step integration process. Wherein we walk through the process from beginning to end, evaluating each step in turn, and thereby thoroughly evaluating the project in question. Further, we will also conduct a validation testing phase, which will directly evaluate the project based on the requirements as listed in the original document.</p>
        
        
        <br>
        <h1>Phase One: Message Hanler Test</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In this first phase, we will be evaluating the effectiveness and functionality of the Message Access Layer (MAL) and the Message Processing Layer (Handler). To do this, our integration tests will construct sample MAL inputs and provide them to the Handler, then the tests will monitor the Handlers actions and final outputs of the inputs. The following tests will directly evaluate the following functional and non-functional requirements from the original document: FR1 - Send and Batch Send Messages, FR2 - Real-Time and Scheduled Message Delivery, FR3 - Message Deduplication, FR4 - Multi-Channel Support, FR5 - Rate Limiting and Traffic Control, FR6 - Night-time Blocking and Next-day Sending, and NFR2 - Scalability.</p>
